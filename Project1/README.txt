List of folders:

Data: Terrain data. For ease of programming, I left copies of these files in the "Functions" folder.
Functions: All the code is here.
plots: Plots generated during exercises. 

List of code files in the Functions folder:


functions.py: Various useful functions used in the exercises.

ex_1.py: The entirety of exercise 1.

ex_2_complexity.py: The part of exercise 2 where I show how the complexity of the model affects the bias-variance trade-off.

ex_2_bootstrap.py: The part of exercise 2 where I use bootstrapping.

ex_3_cross_val.py: The part of exercise 3 where I test cross-validation.

ex_3_bootstrap.py: The part of exercise 3 where I compare cross-validation and bootstrapping.

ex4_simple_test.py: The part of exercise 4 where I do a simple test to illustrate how the value of lambda affects Ridge regression.

ex4_bootstrap.py: The part of exercise 4 where I use bootstrapping to examine Ridge regression.

ex4_comparison.py: The part of exercise 4 where I compare bootstrapping and cross-validation

ex5_bootstrap.py: The part of exercise 5 where I use bootstrapping to examine lasso regression.

ex5_cross-validation.py: The part of exercise 5 where I compare bootstrapping and cross-validation

ex6_complexity_vs_mse.py: The part of exercise 6 where I compare the MSE of the three methods on the terrain data.

ex6_recreate_map.py: The part of exercise 6 where I try to reconstruct the terrain data.
