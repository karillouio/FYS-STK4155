List of files:

* Euler_test.py: A script that used the forward (explicit) Euler scheme to solve the heat equation. Used to compare the neural network's result to.
* NeuralNetwork_classes.py: A file that contains two neural network classes: the PDE solver (functioning) and my non-functional attempt at an eigenvalue solver. The two scripts below depend on this file being in the same folder. 
* PDE_solver.py: A script that creates and trains a neural network to solve a PDE, specifially the heat equation.
* Eigenvalue_solver.py: An attempt to use a similar method as PDE_solver to find eigenvalues.

* report.pdf: The report.

List of folders:
* "Extra": The optional extra exercise was given its own folder, which contains its own README for details.
* "plots" : A folder for the plots used in the report.
