This is the folder for the extra exercise, which revolves around the bias-variance trade-off. 

List of files: 

Utility files that other files may depend on:
* functions.py: Contains various functions
* NeuralNetwork_class.py: Contains a class for neural networks.

Script files:
* OLS.py: A script that can be used for OLS regression or Ridge regression. Currently used for Ridge regression, but some commented-out lines can be used to change it back to the OLS form.
* Decision_Tree.py: A script for the decision tree part. 
* Neural_network.py: A script for experimenting with neural networks. 
* NN_simplified.py: A simpler script for experimenting with neural networks. This variation was created to cut down on runtimes.

Other: 
* report_extra.pdf: The report from this optional part of the project.
* "plots" folder: The plots that were used in the report.
